### Project Thirteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Madlibs
This is a simple program collects user inputs, and prints a sentence based of the output, the sentence is either negative or positive, and it's up to the user to guess right the first time.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate library.
3. Collect the required inputs to send an email: adjective, two verbs, and a famous person.
4. Use the appropriate string concatenation to combine user inputs with generated strings.
5. Create a variable to hold the sentence options available in as a list.
6. Pass the list to the appropriate method/module for a random choice selection.
7. Print the selected random choice.
7. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* I explored once again the use of the random python module in this program.
* The *while True* loop came in handy once again.
* I have understood the three forms of string concatenation and explored them in this program.
